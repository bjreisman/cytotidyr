Version: 0.0.1.100

Description: This package contains a set of functions that are used to convert FCS files stored on Cytobank into a tidy format for downstream analysis in R. In addition to the basic functionality for downloading FCS files, cytotidyr provides a framework for applying compensations, panels, scaling, and gating paramters defined in cytobank to the raw data to faciliate a natural, reproducible workflow from cytobank to R (and back).
